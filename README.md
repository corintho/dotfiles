# dotfiles

Dot files to setup my systems.

It encompasses two systems. A macOS one, which uses home-assistant for setup and a NixOS one.

A better description is coming soonâ„¢.

## Requirements

For either setup to work properly, you need to install nix (or NixOS) beforehand.

You also need to run the script `initialize_paths.sh` before starting.

## Running

Just run `just` and see the description for the options there.
